    SSRC Identifies the synchronization source. The value is chosen randomly, with the intent that no two synchronization sources within the same RTP session will have the same SSRC. Although the probability of multiple sources choosing the same identifier is low, all RTP implementations must be prepared to detect and resolve collisions. If a source changes its source transport address, it must also choose a new SSRC to avoid being interpreted as a looped source.

    CSRC An array of 0 to 15 CSRC elements identifying the contributing sources for the payload contained in this packet. The number of identifiers is given by the CC field. If there are more than 15 contributing sources, only 15 may be identified. CSRC identifiers are inserted by mixers, using the SSRC identifiers of contributing sources. For example, for audio packets the SSRC identifiers of all sources that were mixed together to create a packet are listed, allowing correct talker indication at the receiver.
